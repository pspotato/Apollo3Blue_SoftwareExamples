This example demonstrates with use of STGL5000 how to generate 
I2S audio-output by use of two timer with one timer configured as pattern generator.
 
 Connection:
 STGL5000   <->    Apollo3Blue  Function
 SYS_MCLK   <-     GPIO7        (Master Clock)
 I2S_SCLK    ->    GPIO25       (I2S Bit Clock)
 I2S_LRCLK   ->    GPIO13       (I2S Word-Select Clock)
 I2S_DIN    <-     GPIO25       (I2S Data)  
 CTRL_DATA  <->    GPIO9        (I2C SDA)
 CTRL_CLK   <->    GPIO8        (I2C SCL)
